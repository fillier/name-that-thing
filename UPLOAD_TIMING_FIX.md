# Upload Timing Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The UI was showing image thumbnails before the database save operations completed during image uploads. This created a race condition where users could see images in the UI that weren't actually saved to the database yet.

## Root Cause
1. `onImageProcessed` callback was called immediately after image processing
2. Callback updated reactive store state before database save completed
3. UI reacted to state changes and showed thumbnails prematurely
4. Database save continued in background

## Solution Implemented

### 1. GameSetup.vue Changes
- Modified `onImageProcessed` callback to await database save completion
- Added proper error handling for failed saves
- Removed redundant `loadCategories()` call

### 2. useImageUpload.ts Changes  
- Changed callback invocation to `await options.onImageProcessed(image)`
- Added error handling for callback failures
- Ensures upload loop waits for save completion before continuing

### 3. categories.ts Store Changes
- Modified `addImageToCategory` to save to database before updating reactive state
- Ensures atomic operations: both database and UI update together
- Prevents UI showing unsaved images

## Benefits
- ✅ No more premature thumbnail display
- ✅ Consistent state between UI and database
- ✅ Better error handling for failed saves
- ✅ More reliable upload progress tracking
- ✅ Atomic save operations

## Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Upload multiple images to a category
3. Verify thumbnails only appear after database save completes
4. Check browser console for proper save sequencing logs
